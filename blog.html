                            Today I will be talking about Valorant. Valorant
                            is a good game. I like it. My favorite character
                            to play at the moment is Omen. His ult cannot be 
                            used with abandon, but it can be used effectively
                            to reinforce teammates or to make sneaky plays.
                            And of course, his smokes are instrumental in the
                            success of the team.

                            Playing with a shitty team kills my soul. When I
                            play on an unranked ladder, I hope that the enemy
                            team has as many shitty team members as my team
                            has. If this is the case, then I can make plays.
                            Top-fragging still a given with ya boy.

                            Do I see the game as e-sports worthy? Who knows.
                            Before anybody can answer that question, ranked
                            matchmaking needs to be introduced and a meta
                            needs to be crafted. Whether or not a game is 
                            e-sports worthy depends on two factors: <b>balance</b>
                            and <b>watchability</b>. While I have no doubt
                            that the game will be watchable on a professional
                            level, the question of balance comes to mind. 
                            However, I am leaning towards believing that a 
                            balance is reachable.
