                <p>    My name is Daniel Lenter. I was born in Salem, Oregon
                    but moved to California before I turned one, and have
                    lived in California ever since. I live with my father,
                    Sheldon, and my aunt. I have three brothers, one sister,
                    three nephews, and too many aunts and uncles.

                    <p>I have what I call my "wind-mind". Essentially, the
                        way my mind functions can be likened to the wind:
                        sporadic and frequently changing in speed and direction.
                        Because of this, I have taken to many different 
                        hobbies. In fact, I consider myself a hobbyist hobbyist â€”
                        juggling my hobbies has become a hobby in itself! Some
                        of my hobbies include:

                    <p>I also listen to quite a bit of music. The main genre 
                        that I listened to used to be rap, but my tastes have
                        since branched out and I now listen to a much wider
                        spread of music. However, it's still safe to say that
                        my music library is mainly hip-hop inspired.

                        Mac Miller, at the moment of writing this, is my favorite
                        musician and is the most influential to me in my life.
                        His music has helped me very much, as it has for many others.
